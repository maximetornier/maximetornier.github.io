								<p>Jennifer Dudley is a Curator, Art Historian and PhD candidate at Coventry University. Within the third volume of <i>yellowfields</i>, she will explore women’s sculptural practices in Britain - which have generally been written from the perspective and prejudice of a patriarchal canon of art - to recognise the ongoing contribution of women to an ever-expanding field. She has previously held curatorial roles at National Museum Wales, Cardiff and Edgar Modern Fine Art, Bath. She gained her BA in History of Art from University of Bristol in 2013 and an MA in Curating from University of the West of England in 2016.</div>

                                    <p>Libita Sibungu’s solo and collaborative projects explore the politics of the body and landscape in relation to migration, blackness, and colonialism. The work seeks to unearth lost, buried and hidden testimonies, to reimagine containers of memory and states of liberation emerging out of fugitive experiences. Performance, print, text and sound are often collaged together to express ways of mapping time - manifesting into staged; poetic, immersive and disruptive environments.</p>

								<p>Duffin (lives and works in Bristol) is a visual artist whose works are predominantly sculptural in nature. She employs a process of speculative questioning that draws influence from varied disparate ideas and anecdotes within anthropology, literature, metaphysics and scientific history. She is interested in things that have a sense of self conscious autonomy and the potential to be generative agents.</p><p>

Her interest in books & libraries prompts her collages and sculpture which are often composed of found photographs spliced to create fresh narratives. In March 2016 she was awarded the BMW Art Journey prize at Art Basel, to travel to lost libraries along the Silk Road. A book documenting this journey has been published by Hatje Cantz.

                                    <p>Georgia Hall is a contemporary art curator who builds instructional community-based projects to support and enable the production of new works. Her practice has expanded from making sculpture into a growing focus in socio-political practices. This year, alongside contemporary women designers, artists, curators, art historians and writers, Georgia developed and produced Yellowfields, 2019-20. This project utilises critical development and peer-networking as a curatorial method to commission thematic writing about art practice. 
</p>
                                    <p>
Georgia has previously worked for programming teams in galleries and museums including Spike Island and Arnolfini, as well as other roles at Bristol Biennial, g39 and the National Trust. She is a council member of the EarthArt gallery within the School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol. In 2019, she was generously supported by the Arts Council England and Gane Trust.
</p>
                                    <p>
Georgia graduated with a first-class in Fine Art specialising in sculpture and later received a distinction in curatorial practice.

                                    <p>Freya Dooley (Lives and works in Cardiff). Working across media, writing is at the centre of Freya’s practice, which encompasses unstable narratives, moving image works and soundtracks. Recent projects have manifested as intimate installations, visual essays, spoken performances, listening events, collaborative fictions, publications and other printed matter.
</p>
                                    <p>The work often operates in anxious states: attempts to articulate an inside-turned-out. Seemingly disparate narratives interweave through meandering observations, pop-culture references, literary structures and fictionalised experiences.</p>
                                    <p>Forthcoming exhibitions include Jerwood Solo Presentations, London (2020) and a residency and solo presentation at the Beppu Project, Oita, Japan (2020). Recent projects include New Writing with New Contemporaries with Leeds Art Gallery (2019) and South London Gallery (2020). Recent solo exhibitions include Somewhere in the Crowd There’s You, Eastside Projects, Birmingham (2019); The Song Settles Inside the Body It Borrows, Chapter Gallery, Cardiff, (2019); Speakable Things, Oriel Davies, Powys, (2018). Freya currently holds a two-year Fellowship at g39, Cardiff, which is supported by the Freelands Artist Programme.</p>
