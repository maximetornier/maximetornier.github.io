								<p>Curator, Art Historian and PhD candidate at Coventry University, Jennifer Dudley will be the curatorial writer for the second winter project. She will explore women’s sculptural practices in Britain - which have generally been written from the perspective and prejudice of a patriarchal canon of art - to recognise the ongoing contribution of women to an ever-expanding field. She is also the part time Education and Engagement Curator at NN Contemporary Art, Northampton and has previously held curatorial roles at National Museum Wales, Cardiff and Edgar Modern Fine Art, Bath. She gained her BA in History of Art from University of Bristol in 2013 and an MA in Curating from University of the West of England in 2016.</div>
