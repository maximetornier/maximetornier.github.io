She is also the part time Education and Engagement Curator at NN Contemporary Art, Northampton and has previously held curatorial roles at National Museum Wales, Cardiff and Edgar Modern Fine Art, Bath. She gained her BA in History of Art from University of Bristol in 2013 and an MA in Curating from University of the West of England in 2016.</div>
