								<p>Jennifer Dudley is a Curator, Art Historian and PhD candidate at Coventry University. Within the third volume of <i>yellowfields</i>, she will explore women’s sculptural practices in Britain - which have generally been written from the perspective and prejudice of a patriarchal canon of art - to recognise the ongoing contribution of women to an ever-expanding field. She has previously held curatorial roles at National Museum Wales, Cardiff and Edgar Modern Fine Art, Bath. She gained her BA in History of Art from University of Bristol in 2013 and an MA in Curating from University of the West of England in 2016.</div>

                                    <p>Libita Sibungu’s solo and collaborative projects explore the politics of the body and landscape in relation to migration, blackness, and colonialism. The work seeks to unearth lost, buried and hidden testimonies, to reimagine containers of memory and states of liberation emerging out of fugitive experiences. Performance, print, text and sound are often collaged together to express ways of mapping time - manifesting into staged; poetic, immersive and disruptive environments.</p>

								<p>Duffin (lives and works in Bristol) is a visual artist whose works are predominantly sculptural in nature. She employs a process of speculative questioning that draws influence from varied disparate ideas and anecdotes within anthropology, literature, metaphysics and scientific history. She is interested in things that have a sense of self conscious autonomy and the potential to be generative agents.</p><p>

Her interest in books & libraries prompts her collages and sculpture which are often composed of found photographs spliced to create fresh narratives. In March 2016 she was awarded the BMW Art Journey prize at Art Basel, to travel to lost libraries along the Silk Road. A book documenting this journey has been published by Hatje Cantz.

								<p>Jade Montserrat is the recipient of the Stuart Hall Foundation Scholarship which supports her PhD (via MPhil) at IBAR, UCLan,  (Race and Representation in Northern Britain in the context of the Black Atlantic: A Creative Practice Project) and the development of her work from her black diasporic perspective in the North of England. She was also awarded one of two Jerwood Student Drawing Prizes in 2017 for No Need for Clothing, a documentary photograph of a drawing installation at Cooper Gallery DJCAD by Jacquetta Clark. Jade’s Rainbow Tribe project – a combination of historical and contemporary manifestations of Black Culture from the perspective of the Black Diaspora is central to the ways she is producing a body of work, including No Need For Clothing and its iterations, as well as her performance work Revue.
</p>
                                    <p>Jade was commissioned to present Revue as a 24 hour live performance at SPILL Festival of Performance, October 2018, a solo exhibition at The Bluecoat, Liverpool, (Nov – 10 Mar 2019) which toured to Humber Street Gallery ( July-sept 2019) and was commissioned by Art on the Underground to create the 2018 Winter Night Tube cover.

                                    <p>Freya Dooley (Lives and works in Cardiff). Working across media, writing is at the centre of Freya’s practice, which encompasses unstable narratives, moving image works and soundtracks. Recent projects have manifested as intimate installations, visual essays, spoken performances, listening events, collaborative fictions, publications and other printed matter.
</p>
                                    <p>The work often operates in anxious states: attempts to articulate an inside-turned-out. Seemingly disparate narratives interweave through meandering observations, pop-culture references, literary structures and fictionalised experiences.</p>
                                    <p>Forthcoming exhibitions include Jerwood Solo Presentations, London (2020) and a residency and solo presentation at the Beppu Project, Oita, Japan (2020). Recent projects include New Writing with New Contemporaries with Leeds Art Gallery (2019) and South London Gallery (2020). Recent solo exhibitions include Somewhere in the Crowd There’s You, Eastside Projects, Birmingham (2019); The Song Settles Inside the Body It Borrows, Chapter Gallery, Cardiff, (2019); Speakable Things, Oriel Davies, Powys, (2018). Freya currently holds a two-year Fellowship at g39, Cardiff, which is supported by the Freelands Artist Programme.</p>
